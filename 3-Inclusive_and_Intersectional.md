# Who gets to be the *storyteller* and what are their *responsibilities*? #

To tell a data story, one must have access to the data, tools, and skills necessary to share the information. These limitations are not the only ones which can have an impact. Every decision--from data set, to chart type, to design, to where the story is shared---can affect the ability of an audience to engage with the conversation. Audiences are not a one-size-fits-all crowd, either.

How do we increase equity with our data conversations? What are our powers and responsibilities to make that happen?


## Equity ##
How do we develop more pluralistic data designs---ones which are inclusive of ideas from the full spectrum of genders, races, and cultures? What is the history of this work? Check out how [W.E.B. DuBois represented African-American life in 1900](http://publicdomainreview.org/collections/w-e-b-du-bois-hand-drawn-infographics-of-african-american-life-1900/), [Florence Nightingale](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/florence-nightingale-passionate-statistician), or the work of [Elizabeth Peabody](http://lklein.com/2014/12/visualization-as-argument/) shared by Lauren Klein.

We can use our stories to [recover unusual histories](https://vimeo.com/179040817). At the 2016 Eyeo conference, Sara Hendren talks about "design for Know-Nothings, Dilettantes, and Melancholy Interlopers – Translators, impresarios, believers, and the heartbroken—this is a talk about design outside of authorship and ownership, IP or copyright, and even outside of research and collaboration. When and where do ideas come to life? What counts as design?"

All work with data---from the labels we choose to the charts we design---has potential inequitable impacts. Lena Groeger writes about some of these in [Forms Matter](https://source.opennews.org/articles/forms-matter/): how the design of forms can decide an election, affect racial profiling & shape identity. I also encourage you to visit the [Data Justice Lab](https://datajusticelab.org/) which "examines the intricate relationship between datafication and social justice, highlighting the politics and impacts of data-driven processes and big data."

[Lauren Klein](https://bsky.app/profile/laurenfklein.bsky.social) has written about [visualization as argument](http://lklein.com/2014/12/visualization-as-argument/). You may also be interested in her presentation on [feminist data visualization](http://www.northeastern.edu/nulab/lauren-klein-feminist-data-visualization/) or view [all of her projects](http://dhlab.lmc.gatech.edu/projects/).

What are some **tools** we might use to represent intersectional data? Alex Solokov explores some ideas in Beyond the binary: [Improving data visualization for intersectional identities](https://nightingaledvs.com/beyond-the-binary/).


## Ethics ##
[Lena Groeger](https://bsky.app/profile/lenagroeger.bsky.social) of ProPublica reminds us that "The data doesn't speak for itself---it echoes its collectors." Watch her 2017 Tapestry presentation on [When the storyteller shows up in the story](https://youtu.be/TvJYDz8849g) to think more about how various biases show up in the visuals we produce.

Learn more about [responsible data use](https://blogs.microsoft.com/newyork//2016/01/20/dataviz-for-good-how-to-ethically-communicate-data-in-a-visual-manner-rdfviz/), including the series of [forums](https://responsibledata.io/) where various [handbooks](https://responsibledata.io/resources/handbook/) have been developed to support this work on a larger scale.

What do we do about missing data...and why is it missing in the first place? 
* [Mimi Onuoha](https://mimionuoha.com/) has started a repo to [explore this topic](https://github.com/MimiOnuoha/missing-datasets). 
* At the 2016 Tapestry Conference, Eva Galanes-Rosenbaum shared that [the plural of anecdote is not "data"...except when it is](http://www.tapestryconference.com/blog/2016/plural-anecdote-not-data%E2%80%94except-when-it) as a way to show how we can mitigate the effects of missing data. 
* You may also be interested in this recent post on [four methods to deal with missing data](https://blog.socialcops.com/academy/resources/4-methods-missing-data/). 
* Nathan Yau has also written about strategies to use when [visualizing incomplete or missing data sets](https://flowingdata.com/2018/01/30/visualizing-incomplete-and-missing-data/).
* More importantly, what are we saying when our choice is not to include particular data? Watch the 2016 Eyeo presentation, [Setting Tangents around a Circle](https://vimeo.com/176869833), from [Josh Begley](https://joshbegley.com/) to learn more.
