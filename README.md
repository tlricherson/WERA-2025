# WERA-2025
## Use Data to Tell Your Story ## 
Washington Educational Research Association (WERA) Conference, December 11, 2025

How can educators use the data they collect to create visuals that communicate information and
improve student outcomes? There are powerful stories inside every data set, yet most meaning is never extracted
from the basic numbers. In this session, you will learn to apply best practices of data visualization, as well as basic
principles of visual literacy, to create charts and other displays which communicate effectively with your audience.
We will also consider the rise of feminist data visualization and representations of intersectionality within current
conversations in this area.
