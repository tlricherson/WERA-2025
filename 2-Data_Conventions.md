# Data Conventions #

Many of us were taught to read and write text, but few know the basic rules of creating and interpreting powerful visuals. We will focus on elements of visual communication, including color, chart choice, and other attributes. 

**Visual literacy** is the ability to understand, interpret, and evaluate visual messages. **Visualization literacy** is the ability to confidently use a given data visualization to translate data questions into visual queries ([Boy, et al.](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01027582/document), 2014).

## Tools ##
The resources listed below can provide some guidance when selecting a chart and communicating your data. It is critical to remember that design choices are **not** neutral.  

* There are any number of collections of data viz options. For chart ideas, take a look at the [Data Viz Project](http://datavizproject.com), [The Chartmaker Directory](http://chartmaker.visualisingdata.com/), or [The Data Visualization Catalogue](http://www.datavizcatalogue.com/).
* [Qualitative Chart Chooser](http://stephanieevergreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Qualitative-Chooser-2.0.pdf) by Stephanie Evergreen
* [The Graphic Continuum](https://policyviz.com/2014/09/09/graphic-continuum/) by Jon Schwabish
* [The Data Visualization Checklist](https://stephanieevergreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Data-Viz-Checklist-2024.pdf) by Ann K. Emery and Stephanie Evergreen. There is even a [live version](https://www.datavisualizationchecklist.com/) where you can upload your chart and review it.

It may also be helpful to read about [what questions to ask when creating charts](https://blog.datawrapper.de/better-charts/).

## Resources ##
Learn more about [pre-attentive attributes](https://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/ie/visual_perception.pdf) and their use in this article from Stephen Few.

The same data set can look very different depending upon which chart you choose. Visit [visualizing distributions](https://darkhorsevisualization.com/blog/visualizing-distributions-3) for some examples, but there is additional background on how the [same stats can lead to different graphs](https://www.research.autodesk.com/publications/same-stats-different-graphs/). 

Color can be very tricky. This is a complex topic that we could spend an entire session on. There are some [resources on Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:tlricherson/t:color), including palettes, tools for evaluating your designs for people with vision issues, and best practices from the research.
* Did you know that [blue is the last color most cultures develop a word for](https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-blue-and-how-do-we-see-color-2015-2)?
* Was [Van Gogh colorblind](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/was-vincent-van-gogh-color-blind-it-sure-looks-like-it-27576085/)? While we can't know for sure, there are signs in his paintings that he might have been.
